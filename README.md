# Lottery_Scheduling

•	Use C to implement “nice” UNIX API as extra system call for assigning policy.
•	Utilize QuickTaus algorithm to implement an in-kernel pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for deciding the winning ticket when running lottery scheduler.
•	Choose linked list as data structure and implement an in-kernel function to maintain the policy while a process leaving or entering a system.
•	Design three test cases to test the code by modifying priority and fork multiple processes, and the result meets expectation.
